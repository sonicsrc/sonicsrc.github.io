# Optimizing CI Pipelines for Faster Feedback

Continuous Integration (CI) pipelines are a cornerstone of modern software development. However, as projects grow, these pipelines can become slow and inefficient. In this post, we’ll explore how to optimize CI pipelines to get faster feedback without sacrificing reliability.

## 1. Reduce Build Time with Caching

Caching is one of the simplest and most effective ways to reduce build times. By storing and reusing build artifacts, you can skip redundant steps and dramatically cut down the time spent on building and testing.

For example, with GitHub Actions, you can use the cache action like this:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Cache dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v2
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-node-
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
