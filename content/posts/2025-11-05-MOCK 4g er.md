# Images & Copyable Blocks

This post demonstrates an image, a captioned figure, a copy-friendly command block, and a syntax-highlighted code block.

## Image via Markdown

You can reference images stored in `assets/images/`:

![Mock screenshot](/assets/images/mock-screenshot.png "Mock screenshot")

## Image with caption and sizing (HTML figure)

If you want a caption or to control width, use HTML:

<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/linux-hardening-flow.svg" alt="Linux hardening flow" width="720"/>
  <figcaption>Figure: Linux hardening flow (SVG)</figcaption>
</figure>

> Tip: use root-relative paths (`/assets/images/...`) so the image works the same locally and on GitHub Pages.

## Copyable shell commands

Run these in a terminal. The copy button will remove the leading `$ ` characters so you get runnable lines:

```bash
$ ./newpost.sh "My New Post"
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add post with image"
$ git push
