# Getting Started with Python Static Site Generators

Static site generators (SSGs) have become the go-to solution for developers who want fast, secure, and maintainable websites without the overhead of a full CMS. In this post, we'll explore why Python is an excellent choice for building your own SSG and walk through a minimal, production-ready example.

## Why Build Your Own SSG?

Most developers start with tools like Jekyll, Hugo, or Eleventy. But rolling your own has distinct advantages:

- **Full control**: No black-box behavior or plugin conflicts.
- **Lightweight**: Zero runtime dependencies beyond Python.
- **Extensible**: Add only the features you need.
- **Educational**: Deep understanding of how static sites work under the hood.

> **Technical Note**: An SSG converts source files (usually Markdown) into static HTML using templates. It runs at *build time*, not request time—resulting in sub-millisecond page loads.

## Core Components of an SSG

A minimal SSG needs just four pieces:

| Component       | Responsibility                          | Python Tool       |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Content Parser | Read `.md` files + front matter          | `pathlib`, custom parser |
| Markdown → HTML| Convert syntax to markup                 | `markdown` library |
| Templating     | Insert content into layouts              | `jinja2`           |
| File Output    | Write final HTML + copy assets           | `shutil`, `pathlib` |

That's exactly what our [previous script](link-to-script-post) implements in under 100 lines.

## Example Post Structure

Here's how a typical post looks in `content/posts/`:

```markdown
---
title: My Awesome Post
date: 2025-11-05
slug: my-awesome-post
---

# Main Heading

Regular **Markdown** content goes here.

```python
print("Hello, SSG!")
